# SD69 Gold Badge Challenges

## Description
For the Gold Badge Challenges, I choose to do Challenge: 1, Challenge: 4, and Challenge: 5. I also did Challenge 8 as a bonus to challenge myself. Challenge 1 asked to make a menu for Komodo Cafe  where the owner wanted us to create a console app that allows them to create new menu items, update exiting menu items, delete the menu items, and see a list of all the menu items. For each menu item they wanted each to show a meal number, meal name , a description, list of ingredients and a price. Challenge 4 asked to make a program to store information about company outings. The prompt asked for a list of all outings, the cost of the combined outings and a cost of each outing type of outing combined. The most difficult part of this challenge was the calculation portion. Challenge five asked us to make a program  that used the CRUD methods to create a list of customers, read a list of customers, update customers in the system, and they wanted to be able to delete customers in the system. The prompt asked for the output to be in a list view and show the customers in alphabetical order.
